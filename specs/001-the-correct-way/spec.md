# Feature Specification: The Correct Way

**Feature Branch**: `001-the-correct-way`  
**Created**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "the correct way this time"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a system developer, I want to ensure that feature development follows a consistent and proper methodology, so that we can maintain code quality and consistency across the project.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a feature development workflow that has been inconsistent or incorrect, **When** the "correct way" methodology is implemented, **Then** all subsequent feature development follows standardized procedures
2. **Given** new features being added to the system, **When** they undergo the correct specification, planning and implementation process, **Then** they integrate seamlessly with existing functionality

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a feature specification lacks sufficient detail for planning? The system should return an error with specific information needed.
- How does the system handle conflicting requirements between different stakeholders? The system should flag conflicts for resolution.

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST follow the spec-driven development approach for all features
- **FR-002**: System MUST use the /specify, /plan, and /tasks commands in proper sequence following the spec-driven development workflow
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to create feature specifications using standardized templates
- **FR-004**: System MUST persist feature specifications in the appropriate directory structure
- **FR-005**: System MUST validate feature specifications before allowing progression to planning phase

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Feature Specification**: Document containing user scenarios, requirements and acceptance criteria for a feature
- **Planning Document**: Implementation plan derived from the specification
- **Task List**: Sequence of development tasks generated from the planning document

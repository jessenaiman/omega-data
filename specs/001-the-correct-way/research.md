# Research: The Correct Way Implementation

## Decision: Spec-Driven Development Workflow Implementation
**Rationale**: Implementing a standardized workflow ensures consistency across all feature development, improving code quality and maintainability. Following the spec → plan → tasks → implementation sequence provides clear structure and reduces rework.

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Ad-hoc development without structured workflow
- Agile-only approach without detailed upfront specifications
- Direct implementation without planning phase

## Decision: Technology Stack Selection
**Rationale**: Using Python with FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, and Alembic provides a robust foundation for the workflow system:
- FastAPI for creating API endpoints with automatic OpenAPI documentation
- SQLAlchemy for reliable database operations
- Alembic for version-controlled database migrations
- pytest for comprehensive testing framework

**Alternatives considered**: 
- Node.js with Express framework
- Go with native HTTP package
- Ruby on Rails for rapid development

## Decision: Single Project Structure
**Rationale**: Since this feature is about a command-line workflow tool, a single project structure is most appropriate. This simplifies deployment and maintenance while keeping related functionality together.

**Alternatives considered**:
- Microservices architecture (overkill for this use case)
- Separate CLI and API services (unnecessary complexity for this project)

## Decision: Configuration via Environment Variables
**Rationale**: Following the project constitution's requirement for environment-based configuration ensures that all settings can be managed externally without code changes. This supports different deployment environments (dev, staging, production).

**Alternatives considered**:
- Configuration files
- Command-line arguments only
- Hardcoded values (violates constitution)

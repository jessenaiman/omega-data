# Data Model: The Correct Way Implementation

## Entities

### Feature Specification
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| id | String | Unique identifier for the feature |
| name | String | Name of the feature |
| description | String | Detailed description of the feature |
| created_date | DateTime | Date when the specification was created |
| status | String | Current status (Draft, Planned, In Progress, Complete) |
| requirements | List | List of functional requirements |
| entities | List | List of key entities described in the specification |

### Implementation Plan
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| feature_id | String | Reference to the associated feature |
| plan_date | DateTime | Date when the plan was created |
| technical_context | Object | Details about language, dependencies, storage, etc. |
| project_structure | String | Chosen project structure option |
| phases | List | List of implementation phases |

### Task List
| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| feature_id | String | Reference to the associated feature |
| task_id | String | Unique identifier for the task |
| description | String | Description of the task |
| phase | String | Which phase the task belongs to |
| dependencies | List | List of dependent tasks |
| parallelizable | Boolean | Whether task can be run in parallel |

## Relationships
- One Feature Specification to One Implementation Plan (1:1)
- One Feature Specification to Many Tasks (1:M)

## Validation Rules
- Feature specification must have a unique name within the system
- All requirements must be testable and unambiguous
- Task descriptions must specify exact file paths
- No task should modify the same file as another parallel task

## State Transitions
- Feature specification: Draft → Planned → In Progress → Complete
- Implementation plan: Created → Phase 0 Complete → Phase 1 Complete → Phase 2 Complete
- Task: Not Started → In Progress → Complete
